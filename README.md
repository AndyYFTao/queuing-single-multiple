# Queuing Efficiency for Banking Services - Single Line vs Multiple Lines

Queueing efficiency plays an important role in operational management, and the single-line and
multiple-line queueing models generalize the majority of situations in real life. Taking the banking service
as a specific topic, this project compares the efficiency of these two methods using daily average
customer (customers who have been served) waiting time as an indicator. With the customer arrivals and
service controlled, we perform simulations under the two models using a C++ program and do the
statistical analysis by R. The simulation results show that the single-line model is more efficient than the
multiple-line model in most cases, conforming to the fact that banks usually adopt the single-queue
model.
